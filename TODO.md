Random list of things yet to be done.  All page numbers refer to "The
Verse in Numbers" (see README.md).

* Create and assign textures, atmosphere settings, etc. for
  terrestrial worlds.

* Set proper axial tilt for all worlds (see page 7.03).  Also set
  reasonable random values for rotation parameters (longitude of
  rotation axis, equator ascending node, etc.).  Also set axial
  precession to its proper value (again, page 7.03).

* Set minor eccentricity for all orbits (<0.05 for suns, protosuns,
  and gas giants; <0.30 for other bodies).  Similarly for inclination.
  Also set other orbital values (ascending node, argument of
  pericenter) randomly.

* Create some random asteroids, including major ones listed on pages
  2.25, 2.44, 2.57-2.58, 3.23, 3.54, 4.11-4.12, 4.30, 4.56-4.59, 5.22,
  5.38, 5.51-5.52, 5.67, 5.78, 5.81-5.91, 6.21, 6.23-6.24, and 6.34.  These will
  require some custom textures and meshes.  Also create custom textures
  and meshes for Cortex station 2E, "Sygnus", home of Mr. Universe
  (5.85) and for Six Sigma (5.51-5.52).

* Create custom textures and possibly meshes for Cortex relay
  stations.  (It depends on how much detail we want to give them.)

* For extra credit, create pre- and post-terraforming world textures,
  with appropriate Beginning and Ending values (see Celestia docs).
  That way (for example) setting the Celestia clock to a time before a
  world's terraform date will show the non-terraformed world.
